# Â∞è Chisai!

A micro store library.

## Why does this exist?

I wanted something ...

 * Simple
 * Straightforward
 * Small
 * Predictable

I wanted to be able to have stores as an object. Allowing an array of stores. A store containing store. A store containing a map that holds stores, which hold stores. And so on.
